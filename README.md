# Twitter-Watch
Playing around with rust and web-stuff

Yes, I know that this is not a sane way to do this

### Setup
1. Clone and create a ```.env``` file in the project root with this:
```.env
TW_BEARER_TOKEN="your_twitter_bearer_token_here"
TW_USER="id_of_user_you_want_to_watch"
TW_MAIL_SENDER="email_of_sender"
TW_MAIL_PW="pls_dont_store_important_PWs_in_plain_text"
TW_MAIL_TO="email_of_recepient"
```
2. Run ``` cargo run ```
